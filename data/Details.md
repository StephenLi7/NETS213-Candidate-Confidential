This folder contains data mockups of what it will look like.

The Raw Data will be information on candidates (a basic summary) that will be provided to the MTurkers for the respective candidate they
get as an introduction. This may help in the process of researching and finding their position on a topic.

The QC Data is the data that we will be given as an ouput from our QC model and the calculations we make based on the gold standard
questions.

The Aggregate Module data is a sample of the input we will put into our program that will then provide a score of the person's work.
It will be the output from the HIT we create and it will help us gather data and create a spectrum on the topics and candidates.
