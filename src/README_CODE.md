## How our code runs:

## Analysis we plan on running:
The primary analysis we plan on doing regarding our data is to quickly and effectively gauge where along certain topics the democratic candidates land. By getting quantitative data from the crowd, we can get a more accurate and numeric representation of each candidate.
By putting a numeric value on the topics, our code will output a score of how democratic the crowd grades each candidate on the topics and we can compare the candidates side by side by looking at these values. We plan to have these numeric values outputted from the programs we write that will work with the .csv file that Amazon MTurk outputs from our HITs.

Our hope is to use this analysis to publish a quick and easy way to see the candidates side by side and to help the general public get to know the candidates better to see which democrat (if any) they will be voting for in 2020.
