## How classmates and the crowd can contribute to our project:
Our second HIT is relatively simple for people to contribute to.

1. Open the HIT (you will be assigned a democratic candidate and a topic)
2. From here, you will see a brief introduction to the candidate (basic info) and maybe a few points on their big ideas. For the given topic in the HIT, we ask that the workers go online and search the candidates position on the topic. From an article that is relatively credible, they will formulate an opinion of where on the spectrum that candidate lies for that topic.
3. Use the slider to indicate where you believe the candidate lies on the topic to the best of your ability.
4. The rankings and data provided will allow us to analyze where along the political spectrum each candidate tends to lie given the large number of democratic candidates and if there is one that best fits you as a citizen.
