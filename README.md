## Here is information about our project:
Our final project for NETS 213 is a one stop shop for information about the platforms and views of the 2020 presidential candidates.

Slogan: 2020 Vision for the 2020 Election

From the makers of College Confidential… we bring you Candidate Confidential, the simple and concise place to view each democratic candidate's policies and stances on various political topics for the 2020 election.

#### What problem does it solve?
Candidate Confidential solves the ever-growing issue of uninformed or overwhelmed voters. Some people don’t know who to vote for and don’t want to spend time searching the positions politicians take. Others just don’t know what’s fake news and may make misinformed voting decisions. And others just don’t care! With an important election coming in one and a half years, get up to speed with all of the candidates that have announced their running. After meeting with a TA, we decided that because the only two Republican candidates are Trump (whose policies and stances on topics have been made clear in his presidency) and one other minor candidate, we decided to focus solely on all of the democratic candidates because there are so many running (20 so far).

#### To ensure quality of work provided by the crowd...
1. We will utilize gold standard questions embedded within the MTurk HITs that we publish. These gold standard questions will be an indicator if the workers are actually spending the time to go on google and search the candidates stance on one of the topics. We will have an expected answer on these gold standard questions and if the workers provide answers close to our expected value, then we will award that response with some number of points across the gold standard questions. 
2. We will provide monetary compensation that can serve as an economic incentive that will help ensure the quality of the work from workers.
3. Our quality control module will yield a score to the gold standard questions in our HIT. This score will determine whether they are paid or not. Thus, we will ensure the quality by making sure their work is done well.

## Project Milestones and Point Values:
### Overview
The first part will be the collection of issues that people find relevant to the 2020 election. This part will be done by the crowd, likely on Amazon MT. After receiving these results, the grouping of responses into larger issues will likely be done automatically with some oversight from our group. After we have decided on the topics we want to know about each candidate, we will have another HIT that will ask the crowd to help find out information about these candidates regarding these topics. They will research the position a candidate has on an issue and then from that research determine where the candidate lies along a spectrum. This will also be done by the crowd. From here, we will take the average of those values and be able to conclude from the research of the crowd the perceived stance a candidate has.

### Milestone 1 - HIT Creation (3)
For the first HIT, we will determine a list of political topics or issues as a team. Using this list, we will create a multiple choice HIT and ask each worker to choose three topics that they think are pertinent to the 2020 election.

For the second HIT, we will use the data collected from the first hit and use those topics as the ones we want to gain information of for each candidate. This will be a more robust HIT to develop and will involve asking the crowd to do some quick research and determine the stance a candidate takes on a topic along a spectrum. This second HIT will also include some demographic/background information about the workers. 

As a third HIT, we may attempt to verify the work of the crowd by having the crowd verify that the information provided in the previous HITs was correct based off of the URL they provided. They will also determine whether the news source is credible and unbiased to the best of their abilities.

### Milestone 2 – Publish the HIT (1)

### Milestone 3 – Analysis of data provided by the crowd (4)
We will aggregate the data here. Using majority vote, we will determine what the stance of each candidate is regarding each topic that was deemed relevant by the crowd. From here we will begin to build a database regarding the opinions of each candidate. If more data is required, we may go back and publish the HIT again to obtain more data. 

### Milestone 4 – Verify work of the crowd (4)
In this part, we will take the data provided by the crowd and our analysis and verify that it is acceptable. First, we may publish a third HIT that asks the crowd to verify the information provided by other crowdworkers in our second HIT. Primarily, we will run our quality control module in the program/equation that we run to calculate their score on the gold standard questions. This will verify if the data of that MTurk worker is reliable and able to be used for our final results and report. 

### Milestone 5 – Publish results (4)
Perhaps the most difficult portion of the project will be presenting this information in a user-friendly and easily understandable website. We will likely be building a website using Github to present our findings on each candidate on these topics for the world to see. We may also write a report on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of using the crowd for a project like this. 

## Data
The format of the data will be standardized across all candidates and all topics.
The first thing we will ask for in the HITs is given one of the candidates and a topic, whether they support or are against it. This will help us establish a majority rule in terms of the candidate's stance on the topic.
Next, we'll ask them to do some research on the candidate's stance on the topic and then to rate their position on the topic on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is extremely conservative and 10 is extremely liberal. 
We will ask them to do this task across the topics that are the most important for the 2020 election.
Afterwards, we will gather demographic and background information about the workers. What their political stance is (to understand if there's any bias), their gender, and age. These will give us a better understanding of our workers and potential insights on the data.
