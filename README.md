## Here is information about our project:
Our final project for NETS 213 is a one stop shop for information about the platforms and views of the 2020 presidential candidates.

Slogan: 2020 Vision for the 2020 Election

From the makers of College Confidential… we bring you Candidate Confidential, the simple and concise place to view each candidate for the 2020 election, their policies, and their stances on various political topics.

#### What problem does it solve?
Candidate Confidential solves the ever-growing issue of uninformed or overwhelmed voters. Some people don’t know who to vote for and don’t want to spend time searching the positions politicians take. Others just don’t know what’s fake news and may make misinformed voting decisions. And others just don’t care! With an important election coming in one and a half years, get up to speed with all of the candidates that have announced their running.

#### To ensure quality of work provided by the crowd...
1. For the crowd workers to be paid, we will require them to find a source for the information on the candidate's position they provide and give a link to that source. This will ensure that they are actually finding a source that can later be verified.
2. The crowd workers must find an excerpt within the article that declares the candidate's position.
3. We will only provide monetary compensation in the case that the information is reliable - financial compensation as a means of quality control.
4. We will run a second HIT where other members of the crowd will verify whether the information and sources provided in the first round of HITs are accurate and credible - similar to the photo verifying process where the crowd checked if the image border was correct. 

## Project Milestones and Point Values:
### Overview
The first part will be the collection of issues that people find relevant to the 2020 election. This part will be done by the crowd, likely on Amazon MT. After receiving these results, the grouping of responses into larger issues will likely be done automatically with some oversight from our group. After we have decided on the topics we want to know about each candidate, we will have another HIT that will ask the crowd to help find out information about these candidates regarding these topics. They will provide links and a brief summary of what in the text confirms the stance a candidate took on a topic. This will also be done by the crowd. Hopefully, in the process, we’ll be able to use some sort of automated system to check whether the source they provide is credible based off of some list of credible sources that we can compare it to.

### Milestone 1 - HIT Creation (3)
For the first HIT, we will determine a list of political topics or issues as a team. Using this list, we will create a multiple choice HIT and ask each worker to choose three topics that they think are pertinent to the 2020 election.

For the second HIT, we will use the data collected from the first hit and use those topics as the ones we want to gain information of for each candidate. This will be a more robust HIT to develop and will involve actually asking the crowd to provide a link along with the paragraph that states that candidates position. 

As a third HIT, we may attempt to verify the work of the crowd by having the crowd verify that the information provided in the previous HITs was correct based off of the URL they provided. They will also determine whether the news source is credible and unbiased to the best of their abilities.

### Milestone 2 – Publish the HIT (1)

### Milestone 3 – Analysis of data provided by the crowd (4)
We will aggregate the data here. Using majority vote, we will determine what the stance of each candidate is regarding each topic that was deemed relevant by the crowd. From here we will begin to build a database regarding the opinions of each candidate. If more data is required, we may go back and publish the HIT again to obtain more data. 

### Milestone 4 – Verify work of the crowd (4)
In this part, we will take the data provided by the crowd and our analysis and verify that it is acceptable. First, we may publish a third HIT that asks the crowd to verify the information provided by other crowdworkers in our second HIT. They will check if the information provided is correct based off of the URL they provided. Then, they will determine whether the source is reliable or not to the best of their ability. After this verification is done, we as a team will also randomly choose responses and verify the information provided by the crowd.

### Milestone 5 – Publish results (4)
Perhaps the most difficult portion of the project will be presenting this information in a user-friendly and easily understandable website. We will likely be building a website using Github to present our findings on each candidate on these topics for the world to see. We may also write a report on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of using the crowd for a project like this. 

## Data
The format of the data will be standardized across all candidates and all topics.
The first thing we will ask for in the HITs is given one of the candidates and a topic, whether they support or are against it. This will help us establish a majority rule in terms of the candidate's stance on the topic.
Next, we'll ask for a URL for a website that the workers will have used as their source for determining a candidate's stance on a particular topic for the election. They will provide the link and this will serve as a quality control aspect.
Third, we will ask for the paragraph within the article that they are basing the position of the candidate off of. They can copy paste this but this data will be valuable in ensuring that the workers are actually finding and understanding information on the position the candidate has and it will be helpful for us to verify the work.
From here, we may ask the crowd where on a spectrum they think this candidate is regarding this specific topic in addition to a question on their political views.
