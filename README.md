## Here is information about our project:
Our final project for NETS 213 is a one stop shop for information about the platforms and views of the 2020 presidential candidates.

Slogan: 2020 Vision for the 2020 Election

From the makers of College Confidential… we bring you Candidate Confidential, the simple and concise place to view each candidate for the 2020 election, their policies, and their stances on various political topics.

#### What problem does it solve?
Candidate Confidential solves the ever-growing issue of uninformed or overwhelmed voters. Some people don’t know who to vote for and don’t want to spend time searching the positions politicians take. Others just don’t know what’s fake news and may make misinformed voting decisions. And others just don’t care! With an important election coming in one and a half years, get up to speed with all of the candidates that have announced their running.

#### About the crowd...
The members of the crowd will be the general public. We may also want the crowd to be made up of people motivated in politics or willing to do the work so we may want the crowd to have specific demographics. The primary incentive to participate in this will be financial compensation, in addition to working towards a cause that is informative and helpful to others. By participating, they will help other people become more politically informed. As a human computation project, our project will utilize the crowd as a means of determining important topics to differentiate candidates and collecting the information about the selected political platforms. It could almost be viewed as a forum and social network of some sort. 

#### To aggregate results from the crowd...
We will aggregate the results from the crowd in different ways for each part of the crowdsourcing we will need. The first part will be asking the crowd for topics that will be important for the 2020 election along with important issues in general. We can simply collect and organize the responses by specific word or concept related to some issue. Then we will have a breakdown of the most popular issues for the 2020 election. After the first part, we will aggregate the issues into a list ranking the most popular ones. Then we will ask workers in a second study to find out candidate positions on these topics. From there, we can aggregate that into profiles and list views that we can place on a website we develop for example.

#### To ensure quality of work provided by the crowd...
1. For the crowd workers to be paid, we will require them to find a source for the information on the candidate's position they provide and give a link to that source. This will ensure that they are actually finding a source that can later be verified.
2. The crowd workers must find an excerpt within the article that declares the candidate's position.
3. We will only provide monetary compensation in the case that the information is reliable - financial compensation as a means of quality control.
4. We will run a second HIT where other members of the crowd will verify whether the information and sources provided in the first round of HITs are accurate and credible - similar to the photo verifying process where the crowd checked if the image border was correct. 

#### To evaluate the success of our project...
The project will be successful if we are able to obtain information about the candidates that is credible and relevant to the election. From there, if we are able to present it in a manner that is simple for the public to view, then we will have succeeded in our goal of helping to inform the public regarding the 2020 election. By designing the website in a way that is interactive and pleasing to the eye, we make learning about an important election easier and more enjoyable.

## Project Milestones:
### Overview
The first part will be the collection of issues that people find relevant to the 2020 election. This part will be done by the crowd, likely on Amazon MT. After receiving these results, the grouping of responses into larger issues will likely be done automatically with some oversight from our group. After we have decided on the topics we want to know about each candidate, we will have another HIT that will ask the crowd to help find out information about these candidates regarding these topics. They will provide links and a brief summary of what in the text confirms the stance a candidate took on a topic. This will also be done by the crowd. Hopefully, in the process, we’ll be able to use some sort of automated system to check whether the source they provide is credible based off of some list of credible sources that we can compare it to.

### Milestone 1 - HIT Creation
For the first HIT, we will determine a list of political topics or issues as a team. Using this list, we will create a multiple choice HIT and ask each worker to choose three topics that they think are pertinent to the 2020 election.

### Milestone 2 – Publish the HIT

### Milestone 3 – Analysis of data provided by the crowd

### Milestone 4 – Verify work of the crowd

### Milestone 5 – Publish results
