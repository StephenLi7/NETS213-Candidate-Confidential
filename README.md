## Here is information about our project:
Final Project for NETS 213. A one stop shop for information on the 2020 presidential candidates.
Slogan: 2020 Vision for the 2020 Election
From the makers of College Confidential… we bring you Candidate Confidential, the simple and concise place to view each candidate for the 2020 election, their policies, and their stances on various political topics.

What problem does it solve?
Candidate Confidential solves the ever-growing issue of uninformed or overwhelmed voters. Some people don’t know who to vote for and don’t want to spend time searching the positions politicians take. Others just don’t know what’s fake news and may make misinformed voting decisions. And others just don’t care! With an important election coming in one and a half years, get up to speed with all of the candidates that have announced their running.
